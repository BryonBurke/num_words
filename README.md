Put number into an array
The length of this array tells how many digit are in number
Pop the array. First pop gives the 1s, next gives 10s, next gives 100s, etc
For first three digits:
1. Turn numbers 1-9 into words, 1 = one, 2 = two, etc.
2. Turn numbers 10-19 into words, ten, eleven, twelve, etc.
2. Turn multiples of ten into words. 10 = ten, 20 = twenty
3. Turn multiples of 100 into words by the same method as 1. and add the word "hundred"
4. Join the words into the answer, ie "Three hundred seventy nine"
